## üéØ Design Choices

This section explains the UI/UX and technical design decisions made while building **Tele Care** to satisfy the assignment requirements and to keep the app scalable, maintainable and mobile-first.

### 1. High-level approach
- **Mobile-first, responsive design**  
  - Start styles for small screens and scale up for larger breakpoints. This ensures the app looks great on phones (primary evaluation target) and adapts to tablets/desktops.
  - Justification: assignment explicitly asks for mobile-first and responsiveness is part of evaluation.

- **Component-driven architecture (Atomic / Feature-based)**  
  - Break UI into reusable pieces: `Hero`, `CategoryCard`, `ArtistCard`, `BookingForm`, `Header`, `Footer`.  
  - Justification: improves reusability, testability, and readability ‚Äî important for frontend best practices with Next.js + TypeScript.

### 2. Technology choices
- **Next.js + TypeScript**  
  - Next.js for routing, file-based pages and good developer DX; TypeScript for type-safety and fewer runtime bugs.
  - Justification: required by assignment and helps code quality.

- **Tailwind CSS**  
  - Utility-first styling for fast, responsive layouts and consistent spacing/typography.
  - Justification: makes mobile-first responsive styling concise and consistent; easy to customize theme tokens (colors, spacing).

- **Mock JSON data**  
  - `data/categories.json` and `data/artists.json` used for categories, subcategories and artist listings.  
  - Justification: no backend required; easy to extend and test.
